Abstract / Introduction
It is a bitter reality that some people enjoy elite life in terms of food items whereas others bear hunger. On the one side, people buy extra food and waste it but on the other hand, people lack enough resources to buy food related items. Particularly, a large sum of food is wasted during wedding seasons. Owing to this, Online Spare Food Collection and Supply Management System is proposed with the idea to collect spare food and distribute it among the needy. Using this system, both the needy and the people having spare food make account on the website. Registered donators can share the spare food which is sent to the registered needy. Donators can track the progress and distribution of food. System can generate and manage reports.
